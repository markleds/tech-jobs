$tech => jobs is a single page web app where users can search for jobs in the tech industry by keyword and location (city/state) and if they find a job they are interested in, they can save it to their Journal where they will find a link to apply for the job. The Job Journal allows the user to keep track of the steps they've taken in the application process: date applied, application contact, interview info, etc.
